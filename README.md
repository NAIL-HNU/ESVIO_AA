# ESVIO_AA: IMU-Aided Event-based Stereo Visual Odometry

## Coming Soon

This repository contains the code implementation for our paper titled "Direct Visual-Inertial Odometry with a Stereo Event Camera," submitted to ICRA.

## Abstract

We improve our previous direct pipeline Event-based Stereo Visual Odometry ( refer to the **[ESVO Project Page](https://sites.google.com/view/esvo-project-page/home)** ) in terms of accuracy and efficiency. 

## Comparing with us

We welcome comparative evaluation before this project is open sourced. The original trajectories of ESVO ( Block Matching using 10,000 events ) and ESVIO_AA ( Block Matching using 5,000 events ) have been uploaded.
